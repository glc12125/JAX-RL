# JAX-RL
JAX implementations of various deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

**Main libraries used:**
* JAX - main framework
* Haiku - neural networks
* Optax - gradient based optimisation

**Algorithms:**
| Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) | 1 |
| Deep Q-Network (DQN) | 1 |
| Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) | 1 |
| Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) | 1 |
| Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) | 1 |

**Policies:**
* Epsilon-greedy
* Boltzmann

TODO:
* Full tests for each algorithm
* Other PPO based algorithms?
* Prioritised experience replay
* Multi-agent DQN and DDPG
