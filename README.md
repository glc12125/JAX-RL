# JAX-RL
JAX implementations of various deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

Main libraries used:
* JAX - main framework
* Haiku - neural networks
* Optax - gradient based optimisation

Algorithms:
* Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
* Deep Q-Network (DQN)
* Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)
* Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN)
* Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

Policies:
* Epsilon-greedy
* Boltzmann

TODO:
* Fix imports and package
* Other PPO based algorithms?
* Prioritised experience replay
* Multi-agent DQN and DDPG
